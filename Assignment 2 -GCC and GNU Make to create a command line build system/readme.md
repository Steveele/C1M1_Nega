## GCC and GNU Make to create a command line build system
In this programming assignment you will create a build system using the GNU tools, GCC and GNU Make. This assignment will require you to compile multiple files, link them together and create a final output executable. Some files will be provided for you, but you will need to support two platforms; the host environment and the target embedded system MSP432. The host system will allow you to simulate software on a host platform. The target system will be used in upcoming assignments as we begin to create our microcontroller applications.
